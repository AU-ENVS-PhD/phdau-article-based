This is a PhD thesis template made for paper based thesis at AU-ENVS. Will keep updating it. Tested in overleaf. 
It was modified from [PHDUIO â€“ Monograph](https://github.com/martinhelso/phduio-monograph).

- Changed logo to AU and deep purple. Can be easily modified to your own project. 
- Possible to change paper size set to A4, but by default is the book format (17 x 24 cm) which looks better.
- Title page resize is disabled in case of longer title is needed.
- \citet and \citep are now default. 

Feel free to open an issue or ask us! 


To do:
- Make better mistakes.
