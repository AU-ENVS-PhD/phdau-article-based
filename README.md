This is a PhD thesis template made for paper based thesis at AU-ENVS. Will keep updating it. Tested in overleaf. 
It was modified from [PHDUIO â€“ Article based thesis](https://github.com/uio-latex/phduio-article-based).

- Changed logo to AU and deep purple. Can be easily modified to your own project. Change the line 194 in `phdau.cls` to your own logo or comment it out.
- Added a new feature to build a list of acronyms. Simply add your acronyms to `acronyms.tex` and call the acronyms in writing by using `\gls{}` or `\acrfull{}` etc. More can be refered to this [tutorial](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Glossaries).
- Added new function to display orcid icon. Simply call `\orcid{}` and add your orcid number inside. 
- Added new function to display keywords. Simply call `\keywords{}` and add your keywords inside.
- Possible to change paper size set to A4, but by default is the book format (17 x 24 cm) which looks better.
- Title page resize is disabled in case of longer title is needed.
- \citet and \citep are now default.
